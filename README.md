# Audio server & client

  These are two projects they are working together. This project allows you to send (receive) an audio stream to a remote PC. The client can be a PC or an android device. The default audio devices in the system are used as audio input/output.
  The server is installed on a PC. For testing, the client and servet can be installed on the same PC. Development environment - Qt 5.15.2
